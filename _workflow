Porting to github:

1. Make changes to index.Rmd
update the book with this command in the console: bookdown::render_book("index.rmd")

2. Push the commit in the main branch to github

3. Push the rendered book to the gh-pages branch on the the remote repository by entering this into the Terminal
git subtree push --prefix _book origin gh-pages

If that fails:
git push origin `git subtree split --prefix _book main`:gh-pages --force

If that fails:
manually upload the contents of the _book directory (including all subfolders) to the gh-pages branch of the IntroToReportRx repository.

Notes:
make sure that an empty .nojekyll file exists in the gh-pages branch
The easiest way to do this is in github, add a file, create an empty .nojekyll file
